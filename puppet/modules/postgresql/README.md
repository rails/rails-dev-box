Puppet module for postgresql
============================

Basic usage
-----------

To install the client software

    class {'postgresql':  }

To specify a particular version

    class {'postgresql':
        version => '9.1',
    }

To install the server

	class {'postgresql::server': }

By default, the system-wide locale is assumed to be en_US.UTF-8. If the
locale is not installed or available, you can specify an alternative:

    class { 'postgresql::server':
        locale => 'es_ES.UTF-8',
    }

Again, a particular version

	class {'postgresql::server':
		version => '9.1',
	}

Listen on a specific post / IP address

	class {'postgresql::server':
		listen => ['192.168.0.1', ],
		port   => 5432,
	}

To allow a remote host to connect to the server, now that you are listening
on the Internet.

    class {'postgresql::server':
        listen => ['192.168.0.1', ],
        port   => 5432,
        acl   => ['host all all 192.168.0.2/32 md5', ],
    }

Refer to the [pg_hba.conf docs](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html) for
the specifics of what each possible ACL field can be set to.

To create a database owned by a user

    postgresql::db { 'myuser':
        password => 'mypassword',
    }

This will create `myuser` and then create a database called `myuser`
which will owned by `myuser`. You can override the default locale and
encoding and, if required, specify a different owner. For example:

    postgresql::db { 'mydatabase':
        owner    => 'myuser',
        password => 'mypassword',
        locale   => 'en_AU.UTF-8',
        encoding => 'C',
    }


Read on, if your specific setup does not fall within this
 (admittedly simple) framework.

Create a user
-------------

This creates a role in the database cluster, by default the user
is able to login and will inherit the permissions of any groups it
is a member of.

	pg_user {'pguser':
		ensure   => present,
		password => 'pgpassword',
	}

You can also modify other attributes like whether the user can create
databases (`createdb`), create other roles (`createrole`) or is the
superuser (`superuser`).

For example:

    pg_user {'mighty_pguser':
        ensure     => present,
        password   => 'themightyone',
        createdb   => true,
        createrole => true,
    }


Create a database
-----------------

This creates a database and adds a dependancy relationship to the user

	pg_database {'pgdb':
		ensure   => present,
		owner    => 'pguser',
		require  => Pg_user['pguser'],
	}

The default is UTF-8 and en_US.UTF-8 , for English. If required,
you can also specify both the locale and encoding of a database.

	pg_database {'pgdb':
		ensure   => present,
		owner    => 'pguser',
		encoding => 'UTF8',
		locale   => 'de_DE.UTF-8',
		require  => Pg_user['pguser'],
	}


Notes
-----

This module will not (yet) update either the user or database once they have
been initially created. i.e. changing the `login` permission of a user does not work.
Nor does changing the locale of an existing database.
